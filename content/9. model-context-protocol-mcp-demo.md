```typescript
console.log('foobar')

function copyToClipboard() {
  isClickedCopy.value = true
  // @ts-ignore
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(codeRef.value?.textContent ?? '')
  setTimeout(() => isClickedCopy.value = false, 1000)
}

```

Why are you, an above-average intelligence SWE, letting your manager (who probably doesn't even code) spoon-feed you requirements like you're a baby? Are they serving up tasks like applesauce slop? What's next, are you gonna let your manager coo at you? "Ooooh, good little engineer! Here you go, we prepped this code task juuust for you. Go ahead and implement it. Ooooh! Good job!"
